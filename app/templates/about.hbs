  <h2>Get started quickly</h2>
  <p class="lead">This is a starting point for creating mapping applications that combine the components and style from <a href="https://nycplanning.github.io/labs-ui/">Labs UI</a>, models and components from <a href="https://nycplanning.github.io/ember-mapbox-composer/">Ember Mapbox Composer</a>, and data from <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-layers-api">Labs Layers API</a>.</p>
  <p>Just fork this repository and get started.</p>

  <p>This app incorporates features that we reuse in many of our apps. Components include <strong>bbl-lookup</strong> for searching BBLs, <strong>tooltip-renderer</strong> for showing tooltips on the map, and <strong>lookup-layer-group</strong> for adding layer-group legend items. Labs <a href="https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-search-api">Search API</a> provides a search container for users to search addresses (geosearch) or layer-groups. Comments are added in the code to indicate where to edit when making layer-groups searchable, just search "layer-group search" to find these comments.</p>
